# CAP-Simulation
I simulated a collective action problem I was working on to generate a graph and test our hypothesis

The game runs 100 times.
Each game has N(constant) number of players and m(constant) rounds. 
The number of people who cheat is random in each game and varies
The round the cheaters cheat or free ride is also random and varies in each game
Players stop contributing, once they detech cheating, for the rest of the game.

The function Simulation returns the round cheating occured and the total contribution of the game
A graph of contributions against the round cheated on is graphed from the data collected by running the game 100 times.
